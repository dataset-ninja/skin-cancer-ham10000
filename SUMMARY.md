The dataset consists of 10015 images with 10013 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *melanocytic nevi*, *melanoma*, *benign keratosis-like lesions*, and other: *basal cell carcinoma*, *actinic keratoses*, *vascular lesions*, and *dermatofibroma*.

Images in the Skin Cancer: HAM10000 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 2 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the ViDIR Group in Medical University of Vienna, Austria and University of Queensland, Austria.
