**Skin cancer HAM10000** is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the medical industry.

The dataset consists of 10015 images with 10013 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *melanocytic nevi*, *melanoma*, *benign keratosis-like lesions*, and other: *basal cell carcinoma*, *actinic keratoses*, *vascular lesions*, and *dermatofibroma*.

Images in the Skin cancer HAM10000 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 2 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (10015 images). The dataset was released in 2021.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 7 classes:
